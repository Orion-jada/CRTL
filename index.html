        <h2>Why CRTL?</h2>
        <p>You know those brands that spend millions convincing you their hoodie makes you special? Yeah. That’s not us.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Durable:</strong> Lasts longer than your last situationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal:</strong> No screaming logos. Just enough branding to remind you of your financial mistake.</li>
            <li><strong>Wearable:</strong> Unlike those neon sneakers you regret buying.</li>
        </ul>
